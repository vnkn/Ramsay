    "example2 = \"\"\"A Lowcountry favorite that likely descended from West African jollof rice, this classic tomato and rice dish is also sometimes called Carolina red rice – or simply red rice. It often contains sausage, but this version, inspired by how the chef Millie Peartree’s mother, Millie Bell, used to make it, relies on bacon for its depth. (Still, if you’d like to add sausage, just let it sear with the vegetables in Step 3.) To start, the “holy trinity” (bell pepper, onion and celery) is cooked in the bacon fat, infusing the cooking liquid. Then, the rice is baked to ensure it’s perfectly cooked. Serve this alongside baked chicken or ham, green beans or collard greens, for a full, satisfying meal.The ingredients are Nonstick cooking spray,6 bacon slices,1 medium Vidalia or other sweet, Spanish or yellow onion, chopped,2 celery ribs, chopped,1 large green bell pepper, chopped,1 teaspoon kosher salt, plus more to taste,2 garlic cloves, minced,2 cups long-grain or Carolina gold rice, rinsed until water runs clear,1 (14-ounce) can tomato purée,1½ cups chicken stock or water, plus more as needed,1 tablespoon hot sauce,1 teaspoon Cajun seasoning,1 teaspoon granulated sugar,½ teaspoon black pepper,Pinch of ground cayenne,Parsley leaves, for garnishand the steps are Heat oven to 350 degrees and coat a 9-by-13-inch baking dish with cooking spray.,In a large (12-inch) heavy skillet over medium heat, fry the bacon until crisp, about 3 minutes per side. Remove the bacon to paper towels to drain, leaving behind drippings. Crumble the bacon and set aside.,In the same skillet, add the chopped onion, celery, bell pepper and 1 teaspoon salt, and sauté until the onion is translucent, about 5 minutes. Add garlic and sauté until fragrant, another 30 seconds.,To the skillet, add the rinsed rice. Stir and toast the rice for 30 seconds. Add the crumbled bacon, tomato purée, stock, hot sauce, Cajun seasoning, sugar, pepper and cayenne.,Bring the rice and vegetables to a boil, then reduce the heat to low and simmer for about 5 minutes. Taste and add salt, if needed.,Carefully transfer ingredients to the greased baking dish. Cover the baking dish tightly with foil, and bake until the rice is tender, about 40 to 50 minutes. Check the rice after about 30 minutes to make sure all the liquid is absorbed, and the rice is tender. (If it's too dry or not cooked all the way through, add a few tablespoons of water or stock at a time, if necessary, and cook a little longer.) Fluff with a fork before serving and garnish with parsley leaves.\"\"\""

Cook, undisturbed, until outer edges are brown and undersides are very crisp, about 2 minutes. Flip and place a slice of cheese on top of each patty. Cook until cheese is melted, about 30 seconds. Transfer patties to buns with toppings, stacking 2 patties on each bun. Repeat with remaining 4 patties, scraping off any cheese stuck to griddle in between batches.</p></li></ol></div>'\"\"\""
